# Tennis match

Just a sample project, based on a tennis match, to test with mocha + chai, a web server to test async code, and a Express web API.

## Running Tests Locally

First off, install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) locally. Next you'll need to run a few commands from this folder.

```
$ npm install
```

To run our tests, we will first need to run our server:

```
$ node app/server.js
```

We can now run our tests with npm test in a separate shell session:

```
$ npm test
```
